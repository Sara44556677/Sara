        <h3>Rotating Star Pattern</h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art1.png" width="300px">
        <p>This type of graphic falls under abstract geometric design or symmetrical star pattern with dynamic, random coloring. The code creates a pattern of 36 colorful stars, where each star rotates and creates a layered effect. The randomness in color and the turtle's rotation results in an interesting visual effect.</p>

            <h3> Colorful spiral pattern
            </h3>
            <img src="/static/images/art2.png" width="300px">
            <p>This graphic falls under the category of geometric art or abstract spiral art. The use of vibrant colors and varying pen widths gives it an energetic, visually dynamic quality, often seen in generative art or turtle graphics patterns.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image3">
        <h3> Spiral drawing with triangles
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art3.png" width="300px">
        <p>The pattern created by the turtle is a spiral. Specifically, it's a colorful triangle spiral where each triangle's side length increases as the loop progresses. The turtle rotates after drawing each triangle, creating a spiraling effect. The result is a visually complex and colorful design.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image4">
        <h3> Spinning circle pattern
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art4.png" width="300px">
        <p>The pattern created is a rotating circle pattern. The turtle draws a circle, then turns slightly and draws another circle. This process repeats 36 times, resulting in a spiral-like effect as the circles overlap slightly.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image5">
        <h3> Colorful spiral pattern with a combination of lines and circles
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art5.png" width="300px">
        <p>The type of this drawing is a spiraling pattern with lines and circles. It combines lines that increase in length with circles that grow larger as the pattern spirals outward, and it is made more dynamic by the use of random colors.It can be described as a colorful spiral of lines and circles, or simply a spiraling geometric pattern with increasing sizes and random colors.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image6">
        <h3> Colorful, intricate spiral pattern 
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art6.png" width="300px">
        <p>The type of this drawing can be described as a colorful, spiraling geometric pattern with alternating line lengths and rotating angles. It is a combination of line-based shapes that spiral outward and change colors in a smooth transition, creating a dynamic and visually engaging design.So, the type of drawing is a colorful spiral with lines.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image7">
        <h3> Colorful, intricate spiral pattern 
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art7.png" width="300px">
        <p>The type of this drawing can be described as a colorful, spiraling geometric pattern with alternating line lengths and rotating angles. It is a combination of line-based shapes that spiral outward and change colors in a smooth transition, creating a dynamic and visually engaging design.So, the type of drawing is a colorful spiral with lines.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image8">
        <h3>  Colorful spiral pattern with circles 
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art8.png" width="300px">
        <p>The type of this drawing can be described as a colorful spiral of overlapping circular arcs. It combines arcs with decreasing radii and changes in direction, creating a spiral pattern with a dynamic, colorful effect,So, the type of drawing is a colorful spiral pattern of arcs with overlapping circles.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image9">
        <h3> Colorful spiral pattern using the HSV color model
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art9.png" width="300px">
        <p>The type of this drawing is a colorful spiral pattern with smooth color transitions. The turtle's movement creates an outward-growing spiral, and the use of the HSV color model ensures that the colors transition smoothly through the spectrum as the spiral expands.So, the type of drawing is a smooth, colorful spiral with rainbow-like color transitions.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="image10">
        <h3>Colorful, spiraling pattern of squares
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/Untitled10.png" width="300px">
        <p>The type of this drawing is a colorful spiral pattern with smooth color transitions. The turtle's movement creates an outward-growing spiral, and the use of the HSV color model ensures that the colors transition smoothly through the spectrum as the spiral expands.So, the type of drawing is a smooth, colorful spiral with rainbow-like color transitions.</p>

        <h3>Interactive graphics and visual art program
        </h3>
        <img src="/static/images/art11.png" width="300px">
        <p>This is an interactive graphics and visual art program that generates a colorful, complex geometric pattern using Python's Turtle Graphics and HSV color model for dynamic color transitions.</p>
